# 📚 BRACU CSE Resources

Welcome! 🌟  
This repository contains a collection of **CSE resources for BRAC University courses**. These are materials from the courses I successfully completed, and I’m sharing them here to help others in their learning journey.

## Courses Covered

Below are the courses for which resources are currently available. More courses will be added over time.  

### **CSE110 (Programming Language I)**
- **Java Codes**: Collected from assignments, quizzes (mine and friends’), mids, and final exams.  
  - Organized **topic-wise** for easier navigation.  
  - Within topics, I’ve tried to sort them from **easier to harder**, though some may be less structured.
- **Lab Assignments**:  
  - Includes task PDFs.  
  - **Solutions are not directly provided** - this is to encourage you to code on your own and truly understand the material.

## Why This Repository Exists

I wanted to create a central place for resources that can help fellow BRACU CSE students **learn and understand concepts** without simply giving away ready-made lab solutions. The codes are meant for reference and practice, while lab assignments are left unsolved to encourage real learning and prevent copy-pasting. 💻❤️

## Notes

- Use these resources responsibly and for **educational purposes only**.  
- If you find something useful or want to share suggestions, feel free to contribute.  

Thanks for checking out the repo. Keep me in your prayers! <3

Happy coding! 🚀
